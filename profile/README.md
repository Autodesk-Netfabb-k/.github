Prepares 3D files for printing and converts them to 3D slice files, consisting of a list of 2D slice layers. To perform print preparation operations, Netfabb uses an STL file format to create a mesh of the part. Models created with 3D software such as TriDex are not necessarily suitable for 3D printing and, therefore, for incorporating 3D models from other 3D software.
